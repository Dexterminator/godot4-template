# Godot 4 template

A basic project template featuring utilities like:
- A state machine implementation
- Actions autoload for input actions in code (nice for adding actions for multiple players in a for loop etc)
- Screen shake
- Slowdown (usable for hit stop, slomo etc)
- Delta autoload for tracking in_game time
- Debug overlay
- Scene manager (very simple, but good as a start for specific usage)
- Event bus
- Input buffer
- Example of using Polygon2D for level prototyping (by setting its collision automatically in a script)
- Set data structure
- Unit testing using GUT
- Makefile featuring linting and formatting using gdtools
- Example release script

If using the `test` make target, make sure to edit the path to Godot to the path or alias you are using on your system.
